# Platform Parity Report — Web vs iOS
_Generated 2026-05-27 · Updated 2026-05-28 (card badges + cross-stage fix)_

---

## TL;DR

The web app is a fully-featured team task management tool. The iOS app has reached near-full feature parity. All high- and medium-priority gaps are closed, the card-level UI badges are implemented, and cross-stage task movement works correctly. Only task sharing (low) and bulk import (low) remain.

---

## 1 — Information Architecture

### Web
Single-page app with a persistent left sidebar and a content area.

```
sidebar
├── Board selector (My Boards + Shared with me)
├── View tabs: All · Today · Archived · Dashboard
├── Category filters
├── Notifications bell
└── Account menu (theme toggle, sign out)

canvas
└── 3-column Kanban (Backlog | In Progress | Done)
    └── Task card → in-place detail panel slides open
```

Navigation style: modals and in-place panel expansions. Nothing leaves the page.

### iOS
Imperative stack navigation. No persistent sidebar.

```
LoginScreen
└── BoardListScreen (bell badge, search, settings)
    ├── → NotificationsScreen               ← NEW
    ├── → DashboardScreen
    ├── → SearchScreen
    ├── → SettingsScreen
    └── → BoardScreen (Kanban, drag-to-reorder)
            └── → TaskDetailScreen (modal)
            └── → ArchivedScreen
            └── → BoardMembersScreen
```

## 2 — Feature Gaps

### Remaining gaps (low priority)

| Feature | Web location | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Task sharing** | Share any task into another user's board | Low | `POST /api/tasks/:id/share` not yet in iOS |
| **Import JSON** | Paste a JSON array to bulk-import tasks | Low | No API call for this exists |

### Closed in feat/taskly-web-overhaul (2026-06-10)

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Today → task detail (subtasks) | ✅ Tapping a Today task row now navigates to `TaskDetailScreen` (modal), which renders subtasks. The checkbox remains a separate `Pressable` that still toggles done without navigating. `TodayStackParams` already included `TaskDetail`; only `TodayScreen.renderItem` needed wiring. |

### Closed in card-badges sprint (2026-05-28)

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Status/notes inline preview on card | ✅ `↳ <status>` shown below task text; hidden when empty |
| Repeat indicator badge | ✅ 🔁 badge in badges row; shown when `recurrence` is non-null |
| Cross-stage task movement | ✅ `NestableDraggableFlatList` keyed on stage+count; tasks move visually on "Move →" |

### Closed in TDD sprint (2026-05-27)

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Task notes / status field | ✅ TextField in TaskDetailScreen, saved in payload |
| Recurrence picker | ✅ 8-option chip row in TaskDetailScreen |
| Assigned-to user picker | ✅ Live search + selection, saved as `assigned_to_user_id` |
| Calendar fields (cal_start, cal_end) | ✅ Date inputs in TaskDetailScreen |
| Notifications bell + screen | ✅ Bell badge with unread count in BoardListScreen header; NotificationsScreen with mark-all-read |
| Delete category | ✅ × button per category in TaskDetailScreen category selector |
| Board rename / delete UI | ✅ Long-press board row → ActionSheet → Rename (Alert.prompt) / Delete (confirmation) |
| Drag-to-reorder within a stage | ✅ NestableScrollContainer + NestableDraggableFlatList per stage; ScaleDecorator; reorder API call on drag-end |

### Closed in earlier sprints

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Subtask CRUD | ✅ Add / toggle / remove in TaskDetailScreen |
| Archived tasks screen | ✅ ArchivedScreen with restore and delete |
| Board member management | ✅ BoardMembersScreen — invite, revoke, remove |
| Shared boards in BoardListScreen | ✅ "Shared with me" section with owner info |

## 4 — Design Comparison

### Tokens: identical ✓

All design tokens remain aligned (see original report for the full table).

### Layout patterns: intentionally different, functionally equivalent

| Aspect | Web | iOS | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kanban layout | 3 horizontal columns | 3 vertical sections, drag-to-reorder | Platform-appropriate |
| Board navigation | Sidebar click | Stack push from BoardList | Platform-appropriate |
| Task detail | In-place panel | Full modal screen | Functionally equivalent |
| Notifications | Dropdown from bell | Bell → NotificationsScreen | Platform-appropriate |
| Board rename/delete | Settings modal | Long-press → ActionSheet | Platform-appropriate |
| Category delete | Board settings | × button in task detail | Functionally equivalent |

## 5 — Recommended Next Steps

### Low — nice to have
1. **Task sharing** — `POST /api/tasks/:id/share` UI
2. **Import JSON** — bulk import via a paste input
